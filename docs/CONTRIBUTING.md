I welcome contributions to AssetRipper and have accepted many patches, but if you want your code to be included, please familiarise yourself with the following guidelines:
* Your submission must be your own work, and able to be released under the GPL license.
* You will need to make sure your code conforms to the layout and naming conventions used elsewhere in AssetRipper.
* Try to write "clean code" - avoid long functions and long classes. Try to add a new feature by creating a new class rather than putting loads of extra code inside an existing one.
* If you are adding a new feature, please consider writing a short tutorial on how to use it.
* Unless your patch is a small bugfix, I will code review it and give you feedback. You will need to be willing to make the recommended changes before it can be integrated into the main code.
* Patches should be provided using the Pull Request feature of GitHub.
