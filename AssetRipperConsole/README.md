# AssetRipperConsole

This is intended to become a cross-platform command line application. Drag and drop resource file(s) or/and folder(s) onto the .exe to retrieve the assets. It will then automaticly try to find resource dependencies, create a 'Ripped' folder and extract all supported assets into the created directory.
